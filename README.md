### How It Works

1. **Form Submission**
   - Users enter the expense details in the form fields (description, amount, date, and category) and submit the form. The expense is then added to the list and stored in the local storage.

2. **Expense Storage**
   - Expenses are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage. This allows data to persist across page reloads.

3. **Displaying Expenses**
   - Expenses are displayed in a list format. Users can see the description, amount, date, and category of each expense. Each item also includes a delete button.

4. **Updating the Chart**
   - The pie chart updates automatically when new expenses are added or when filters and sorting options are applied. The chart reflects the total amounts spent in each category.

5. **Filtering and Sorting**
   - Users can apply filters and sorting options to refine the displayed expenses. Filters adjust the expense list based on date and amount ranges, while sorting organizes the list according to the selected criteria.

6. **Budget Management**
   - Users can set a budget limit, which is saved in local storage. The application calculates and displays the total spent, remaining budget, and provides an overview of the budget status.

7. **CSV Export**
   - Users can export their expense data as a CSV file, making it easy to share or analyze the data using other tools.
